# Redux-start

A redux starter kit I created for myself to set the redux development env in a swifter way.

## Running

First `npm install` to grab all the necessary dependencies.

Then run `npm start` and open <localhost:4994> in your browser.

## Production Build

Run `npm build` to create a distro folder and a bundle.js file.
